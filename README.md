Deep learning project implementing PointNet++ for semantic segmentation of large-scale outdoor point clouds using the Semantic3D dataset.

## Project Overview

This project implements state-of-the-art 3D point cloud semantic segmentation using PointNet++ architecture. The model classifies each point into 8 semantic categories:

- Man-made terrain
- Natural terrain
- High vegetation  
- Low vegetation
- Buildings
- Hard scape
- Scanning artifacts
- Cars

## Current Status

- [x] Project setup and requirements
- [x] Literature review and research
- [x] Basic PointNet++ model architecture
- [x] Dataset class structure
- [x] Training configuration
- [ ] Data preprocessing pipeline
- [ ] Complete model implementation
- [ ] Training loop and optimization
- [ ] Evaluation metrics
- [ ] Visualization and demo app

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/debanjan06/semantic3d-pointcloud-classification.git
cd semantic3d-pointcloud-classification
conda create -n semantic3d python=3.9
conda activate semantic3d  
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Technical Approach

- PointNet++: Hierarchical feature learning for point clouds
- Set Abstraction: Multi-scale feature extraction
- Feature Propagation: Dense prediction for semantic segmentation
- Multi-modal Input: XYZ coordinates + RGB colors + intensity

## Target Applications

- Urban planning and smart city applications
- Autonomous vehicle perception
- Environmental monitoring
- Infrastructure assessment
- GIS and mapping workflows

## ðŸŽ® Interactive Demo Results

The demo showcases the complete PointNet++ inference pipeline:

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Model Architecture | âœ… Complete | Full PointNet++ implementation |
| Real-time Inference | âœ… Working | ~0.15s per 4K points |
| 3D Visualization | âœ… Interactive | Plotly-based exploration |
| Export Functions | âœ… Ready | CSV/JSON for GIS integration |
| Training Pipeline | ðŸ”„ Next Phase | Requires Semantic3D dataset |

**Note**: Demo uses untrained weights for architecture demonstration. 
Production deployment requires training on labeled Semantic3D data.
